## SYSTEM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Automated Email Categorization

**Implement automatic email categorization on ingestion:**

- Etsy sales → Auto-create work item with source="etsy"
- Shopify orders → Auto-create work item with source="shopify"
- Subject contains "custom" + inbound → Flag as custom order inquiry
- Subject contains "design", "proof", "approval" → Flag as design review
- From known spam/marketing domains → Auto-archive
- All other inbound → Mark for manual triage

### 2. Automatic Work Item Creation

**Auto-create work items for:**

- Etsy sales (parse order details from email)
- Shopify customer messages (create assisted_project)
- First-time customer inquiries (create lead/inquiry work item)
- Thread emails to existing work items based on subject/participants

### 3. Email Threading & Linking

**Improve thread management:**

- Use provider_thread_id to automatically link all emails in a conversation to the same work item
- When creating work item from email, link all previous emails in thread
- Show full email thread timeline in work item detail view

### 4. Triage Queue Improvements

**Build a smarter triage system:**

- Separate queues: "Needs Work Item", "Needs Response", "Design Review", "FYI Only"
- Priority scoring based on: customer history, response time, thread length
- Bulk actions: archive spam, create work items, assign to team members
- Smart filters by category, has attachments, response time

### 5. Response Time Tracking

**Add SLA monitoring:**

- Set target response times (e.g., 24 hours for customer inquiries)
- Alert when emails approach SLA deadline
- Dashboard showing response time metrics by category
- Flag slow-to-respond threads for escalation

### 6. Customer Context

**Enrich customer data:**

- Link emails to customer records automatically
- Show customer history: all work items, all emails, total revenue
- Identify VIP customers (high email volume or high order value)
- Tag customers with special notes/flags

### 7. Template & Automation Opportunities

**Based on common patterns, create:**

- Quick reply templates for common questions (lead times, customization options, pricing)
- Auto-responses for received inquiries ("Thanks, we'll respond within 24 hours")
- Follow-up automation (if no response in X days, send gentle reminder)
- Design approval reminders

### 8. Spam/Noise Filtering

**Reduce noise:**

- Auto-archive: 142 emails identified as spam/irrelevant
- Blacklist domains: substack.com, ringcentral.com, tiktok notifications, etc.
- Whitelist customer domains to ensure real inquiries never missed
- Manual spam reporting to improve filters

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

1. **Triage 744 untriaged emails** - Start with customer inquiries first
2. **Link 519 customer inquiries to work items** - These are likely lost leads
3. **Archive 142 spam/irrelevant emails** - Clean up the noise
4. **Auto-create work items for 6 Etsy sales** - Should have been automatic
5. **Auto-create work items for 43 Shopify messages** - Customer service inquiries
6. **Implement email categorization rules** - Prevent future backlog
7. **Set up triage queue dashboard** - Make it easy to process emails daily
8. **Create response templates** - Speed up common responses
