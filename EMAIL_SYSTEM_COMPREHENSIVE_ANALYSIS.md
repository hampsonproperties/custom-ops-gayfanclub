---

## SYSTEM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. AUTO-CATEGORIZATION RULES (Implement FIRST)

**Auto-Create Work Item:**
```
IF from: transaction@etsy.com AND subject contains "sale"
  → Create work item, source="etsy", parse order details

IF from: mailer@shopify.com AND subject contains "customer message"
  → Create work item, type="assisted_project"

IF from: [NEW customer email] AND subject contains "custom|inquiry|quote"
  → Create work item, type="assisted_project", triage_status="needs_response"

IF subject contains "missing|damaged|wrong|issue" AND direction="inbound"
  → Create work item, type="support_issue", priority="high"
```

**Auto-Archive (Spam):**
```
IF from contains: tiktok.com, ringcentral.com, substack.com,
                  instagram.com, alibaba.com, walmart.com
  → triage_status = "archived"
```

**Auto-Link to Existing Work Item:**
```
IF provider_thread_id matches existing work item
  → Link email to that work item

IF subject contains order number (e.g., "#6592")
  → Link to work item with that Shopify order number
```

### 2. PRIORITY QUEUE SYSTEM

**HIGH PRIORITY (Response needed within 4 hours):**
- Support issues (missing, damaged, delays)
- Design approvals pending >24 hours
- Customer waiting for response >24 hours
- B2B/Corporate inquiries

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Response within 24 hours):**
- New custom order inquiries
- Quote requests
- Order status checks
- Design revision requests

**LOW PRIORITY (Response within 48 hours):**
- General information
- Follow-ups on items in progress
- FYI emails

### 3. RESPONSE TEMPLATES (Top 10 Needed)

Based on frequency analysis, create templates for:

1. **Customization Options** (316 uses) - "Our fans are fully customizable. You can choose..."
2. **Design Process Explanation** (111 uses) - "Here's how our design process works..."
3. **Shipping Options** (97 uses) - "We offer standard and expedited shipping..."
4. **Order Tracking** (44 uses) - "Your order tracking number is..."
5. **Design Approval Request** (41 uses) - "Your design is ready for approval..."
6. **Pricing/Cost Quote** (32 uses) - "For a custom order of [X] fans, pricing is..."
7. **UV Reactive Info** (16 uses) - "Our fans are not UV reactive, however yellow and pink..."
8. **Lead Time/Timeline** (14 uses) - "Our current lead time is 45 days..."
9. **Sample Availability** (12 uses) - "We can provide a sample for $35 design fee..."
10. **Bulk/Wholesale Pricing** (12 uses) - "For bulk orders over 100 units..."

### 4. TRIAGE DASHBOARD

**Build 4 separate queues:**

1. **Needs Work Item** - Customer inquiries not yet linked
2. **Needs Response** - Customers waiting for reply
3. **Design Review Queue** - Awaiting approval/revision
4. **FYI/Archive** - Informational only

**Features needed:**
- Bulk actions (archive spam, create work items, assign)
- Filters (by category, priority, age, has attachments)
- SLA indicators (red/yellow/green based on response time)
- Quick actions (respond with template, create work item, archive)

### 5. EMAIL THREADING IMPROVEMENTS

**Current problem:** Emails in same conversation aren't linked to same work item

**Solution:**
- Use `provider_thread_id` to auto-link all emails in thread
- When creating work item from email, link ALL previous emails in that thread
- Show full email timeline in work item detail view
- Thread-aware responses (see full context)

### 6. SPAM FILTERING

**Auto-archive domains:**
```javascript
const spamDomains = [
  'substack.com',
  'ringcentral.com',
  'tiktok.com',
  'instagram.com',
  'alibaba.com',
  'walmart.com',
  '360onlineprint.com',
  // Add more as identified
];
```

**Result:** Reduce inbox noise by 142+ emails (14.2%)

### 7. CUSTOMER CONTEXT ENRICHMENT

**Link emails to customer records automatically:**
- Match email address to existing customer
- Show customer history (all work items, all emails, total revenue)
- Flag VIP customers (high volume or high value)
- Display customer tags/notes

### 8. FOLLOW-UP AUTOMATION

**Based on stage, auto-schedule follow-ups:**
- Design sent → No response in 3 days → "Gentle reminder to review design"
- Quote sent → No response in 5 days → "Following up on your quote"
- Order shipped → After 7 days → "How did we do? Please review"
